### The following questions are about particle systems/VFX and their properties (speed/duration, size, amount of particles & particle systems, placement of VFX)
1. On a scale of 1 to 5, what do you think of the VFX used for the player's/enemies death?
	Please explain your choice.
2. On a scale of 1 to 5, what do you think of the VFX used for firing shells?
	Please explain your choice.
3. Any other suggestions for particle systems in any way, not just tank-related?

### The following questions are about the HUD (Heads Up Display)/UI (User Interface).
1. On a scale of 1 to 5, what do you think of the firing-related UI (shell type, ammo count, reload progress, crosshair)?
	Did you, before reading the question, fully understand what each element represents, and if not, how do you think it can be improved?
2. On a scale of 1 to 5, what do you think of the health-related UI (for both the player and the enemy)?
3. On a scale of 1 to 5, what do you think of the popup system and the way it conveys information?
	Think of aspects such as popup size/location, text readability, missing information, etc.
4. On a scale of 1 to 5, what do you think of the post processing effects?
	 - Think of intensity, specific effects that are missing, adjustments to existing effects.
	 - Post processing effects are only present in the ADS view and the Game Over view, at the moment.
	 - Any suggestions for post-processing for other aspects of the game?
1. Suggestions for any improvements that were not covered by previous questions in regards to the UI?


### The following questions are about the player controls (moving, camera)
1. On a scale of 1 to 5, what do you think of moving the tank (specifically the hull/lower part) around?
	- Think of:
		- Moving forwards and backwards
		- Rotating the tank
	- You can use the environment as a measurement to see how fast you're moving.
2. On a scale of 1 to 5, what do you think of rotating the turret (including the barrel)?
	 - Think of the full 360Â° rotating, in all the camera modes
	 - What do you think of the limit of how far the barrel (cannon) can move up and down?
	 - Do you think the gameplay would benefit from a zooming function in the ADS view?

### The following questions are about the custom editor window for the tank values.
Please also answer these questions if you do not feel comfortable navigating Unity, as it's a designer tool and they should be accessible for people with little Unity-experience as well.
1. On a scale of 1 to 5, how convenient do you think it is to find a tank which you want to edit?
    If your answer is 3 or lower, what do you think can be improved in terms of UI design or tool functionality?
2. On a scale of 1 to 5, what do you think of the layout of the tank properties (fire power, wheel collider properties)
3. Are there any other things you miss from the custom tank editor, or any improvements that were not covered by the previous questions?


1. Do you have any feedback/ideas/complaints that were not covered by the previous questions? It can be about anything (level design, gameplay, mechanics)
