- [ ] Credits showing in main menu
- [x] Pause menu in level
- [ ] Main menu UI elements
	- [x] Background buttons
	- [x] Different font?
	- [x] Button animations
- [x] Main menu more particle systems
- [ ] Research post processing more
- [ ] Test damage registration system for player more (damage registered correctly?)
- [x] Fix post processing activating when in repair mode and camera enters ADS post process volume
- [x] Fix bug where editor pauses when pressing F to inspect enemy in 3rd person
- [x] Apply post processing to player & hostile tank inspection.
- [x] **Fix gear shifting** - SCRAPPED
	- [x] Better WheelCollider values
	- [ ] Better graphs (= more realistic RPM)
	- [ ] Prevent accelerating from 0mph in anything > 1st gear
	- [x] Rotating doesn't really work
	- [ ] Dynamic center of mass
		- [ ] Moves to the opposite direction of where the tank moves
		- [ ] Rotating to the right? CoM moves left slightly, to balance the tank and prevent flipping ove
		- [ ] 
- [x] Remake movement system
	- [x] Raycast from "wheels" to ground
	- [x] Get normal from raycast hit.
	- [x] Get average of the returned vectors to determine ground coverage and therefore speed of tank
	- [x] Handle speeding/braking by adding force
	- [x] Screenshake on drive? Adjusting FOV on drive?
	- [x] When switching zoom level, lerp FOV to new level for a smoother transition
	- [ ] Dynamic particle systems on drive (more smoke when driving, less smoke when stationary?)
- [ ] Camera wall detection
- [ ] Better level design
	- [ ] Village expanding
- [ ] Test AI agents more
	- [x] When close to eachother, prevent pathfinding in a range of enemy agent
	- [ ] Fix turret overshooting
	- [x] Player not detected correctly > not switching to shoot node.
	- [x] Repairing? Not tested yet if it works.
	- [ ] Tank doesn't correctly move towards a cover position before repairing.
	- [x] Tank doesn't "die" (stop moving) on destruction. Just continues behaviour tree. Add node to check if is dead.
	- [x] Tank doesn't respond to being shot. Add behaviour for that
	- [ ] On being shot, cover points keep being generated until timer runs out?
	- [x] After exiting the "check if shot" phase, the turret doesn't rotate back to the target patrol point but stays in the current rotation.
	- [x] In the behaviour tree, assign parent node as parent to child node so navigating through the tree is a bit easier
- [ ] Different ammo types? (remove UI if not implemented!)
	- [ ] Armor penetrating
		- [ ] Do an absolute amount of damage to health & armor
	- [ ] High explosive
		- [ ] Removes a large amount of armor at a time
	- [ ] High Explosive Anti tank
		- [ ] ?
- [ ] Fix bug where the crosshairs move offscreen when the turret rotates slower than the camera
- [x] Change reload indicator position together with crosshair
- [x] Fix crosshairs not being fully aligned when the turret does not move
- [x] Fix being able to use the ADS zoom in 3rd person
- [x] Fix tank floating in air on death (??) 
- [ ] Fix target crosshair incorrect position/not following enemy tank
- [ ] On tank death polishing?
	- [ ] More VFX
	- [ ] Sound effects
	- [ ] Camera tweening
- [x] Add SFX
	- [ ] Background music
	- [ ] Engine sounds
	- [x] Wind (desert?)
- [x] Compile list of future features
	- [ ] Tank customization
	- [ ] FPS combat
- [ ] Optimizing performance
- [ ] Write report
	- [ ] EAAA source mentioning
- [ ] Documenting project
- [ ] Import missing assets on laptop for meetings (skybox, other model packs)
- [ ] UML diagrams
